# Rəvan's Portfolio Website

This website is my personal portfolio project, created in 10th grade out of my own interest.  

You can customize it however you like:  
- Add your own profile links (Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.)  
- Change the background and main colors  
- Edit the text to suit your own style  

## About the Project

- Includes parallax effects and simple animations
